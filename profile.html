              <h2>Finished Jobs</h2>
              <p>
                
1.Accounting/Bookkeeping: You should always keep an eye on your overall financials. However, you can likely delegate the smaller daily tasks, such as sending out invoices, inputting financial information, managing payroll and maintaining records.
<br>
2.Administrative: Managing your calendar, scheduling appointments, returning phone calls, booking travel plans and even sorting through emails are all tasks that seem quick, but may add up to quite a bit of time in the average day. Using a virtual (or in-house) assistant may save you several hours.
<br>
3.Customer service: Once your business grows, you don’t have to be the first person customers call for help or with complaints. You might delegate this task to an employee.
<br>
4.Data entry: Data entry is still required for some tasks, such as inputting customer names and email addresses into your email marketing solution. If possible, postpone data entry until you’ve got enough names to make it worthwhile, and then outsource it.
<br>
5.IT support: Learning how to solve your and your employees’ computer problems may take more of your time than hiring someone to handle it. Consider services from companies such as Best Buy’s Geek Squad, which provide tech support for an annual fee, or find a local IT consultant you trust to help you. A good consultant may go beyond problem solving and troubleshooting to help you plan for growth.
<br>
6.Marketing: Although you need to oversee your overall marketing strategy and plan, you may likely save a lot of time and effort by finding experienced marketers to handle the day-to-day aspects of marketing, such as writing ad or website copy, designing and placing ads, and scheduling blog posts or social media content.
<br>
7.Packing and shipping: Whether you're sending out direct mail pieces and promotional products or fulfilling product orders, you might delegate the envelope-stuffing, packing and labeling to someone else.
<br>
8.Production: Even if your business makes handmade products, such as jewelry or housewares, you might delegate production at some point so the business can grow beyond your own capacity.
<br>
9.Website: Designing, updating and securing the safety of your business website may be jobs best left to a professional, since the rules in this area are constantly changing.
<br>
10.Writing: Running a small business may require lots of writing, from proposals and blog posts to white papers and reports. Even if you’re a good writer, you might save time by having an employee or freelance writer write a first draft and then putting your own spin on it to create the final version.
